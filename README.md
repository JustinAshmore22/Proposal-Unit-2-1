# Arcade NBA Playoffs: Unit 2 Project
    -By Justin Ashmore and Ben Crosby

## Why we chose it:
- We chose this project because we both like sports. Basketball was the easiest to make Rosters on since it's only 5 people on the court at a time. We started off the game with a different idea of direction we wanted to take the game, but we figured out what we wanted to do with and what cool features we wanted to add.


## Description
- This is a basketball game where you face off against other players in the NBA. We made a file for every team(30 to be exact) containing their starting 5. From here we implemented the gameplay. You can either do a dunk, a layup, a mid-range or a 3. We gave the players overalls based on there skill and their overall affects how well they play. The better the player is the more likely they are to make a shot.

## Style Guide

- [ ] Code should be formatted with the replit auto-formatter.
- [ ] Variables should have meaningful names that accurately describe what they refer to.
- [ ] No sloppy/unnecessary/commented out code.
- [ ] Functions defined at the top of the file
- [ ] Application is implemented inside `main` function that is called inside `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- [ ] Input is collected with input helper functions.
- [ ] Input helpers use validation functions that don't contain side effects and are tested thoroughly.
- [ ] Any significant pure logic is extracted and tested thoroughly.
- [ ] All functions have type annotations and pass the type checker.
