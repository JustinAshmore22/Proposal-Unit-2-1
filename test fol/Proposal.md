# Proposal: Unit 2 Project
## By (Ben Crosby and Justin Ashmore)

### Description:
A basketball simulator that lets the user pick a team to play as. They will be able to play against other teams. The score will not be a regular NBA game score it will be more of a street ball score, so that the game will not last as long hopefully.



### Prior Art:
Module 8- Persistence for the rosters. We will rely heavy on Ranint(). We will use Dictionaries and list to get the teams and they will be set in stone so they will be tuples.


### Core User Work Flow:
The user will be able to pick a team and play as that team. The users team will have to beat each team that is ahead of him and go to the finals. The goal is to win the NBA Finals.



### Tuesday- Thursday Daily Goals:
- [ ] Tuesday -

        We will set up matches and make sure everything works correctly.


- [ ] Wednesday - 

        We will run the game and finalize the ending of the matches and the game itself.


- [ ] Thursday - 

        We will practice going over the project and make sure everything runs correctly.
        

### Utilization Of Unit 2 Content:
We used a dictionary for the teams. We used files to store the starting players in. we used 2 dataclasses one for the dictionary and the other for the user.
